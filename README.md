Work Day Scheduler

***Work Day Scheduler***

Using html and CSS starter code, I utilized JQuery within JavaScript to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


## Completed Steps:

* Utilized various stylesheets to create a user-friendly calendar
* Created a timer within the Jumbotron that reflect the current date time
* Utilized Bootstrap to create a responsive container and organize my html time-blocks
* Created functions to set and get information from local storage
* Used JQuerey to populate past, present, and future colors associated with the current time
* Created a function to clear the data from local storage
* Created README file with link & screenshot
